					The force that through the green fuse drives the flower (2023) is a series of site-specific film
					installations in East Haddam, Connecticut during residency at I-Park. Interested in film's
					materiality and decomposition overtime as a metaphor for memory's gradual dissolution, I placed 35mm
					single frames and 16mm filmstrips at various locations within I-Park. These celluloid films are
					expected to slowly decay as being exposed to the four seasons - the sun, wind, rain and snow - and
					blending into the natural world.
