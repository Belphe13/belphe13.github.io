				<p>DESCRIPTION</p>
			</div>
			<div class="description">
				<p>
					Inspired by J√∏rgen Leth's Black and White cult classic <i>The Perfect Human</i> (1968) which raises
					many simple yet philosophical questions about who the perfect human is, what it means to be human,
					or perfect, this work applies unsupervised machine learning and experimental filmmaking techniques
					to reexamine and question the contested notion of perfection in the eyes of artificial intelligence.
					Later the remake of the computer-generated moving images are transformed from digital recreation to
					an analog artifact of transparencies which completed the cycles from analog film to digital video
					and back to 16mm format, from motion pictures to still images, and then latent-space interpolation,
					from a proxy of human memories to the machine learning construct.

				<p>WHY PERFECT HUMAN?</p>
			</div>

			<div class="description">
			<p>
			To some extent, every film is staged. The original film by Leth was obviously staged in a boundless space. It was filming a middle-class Danish couple performing everyday rituals as if they are subjects in a zoo and the film itself examines human behavior in a "suave, pseudo-scientific" way. It is an unrealistic environment to portray the non-existing perfect human in a bright demonstration room with dissection lights. White background successfully situates the concept of perfect human far from the reality.

				<p>PROCESS</p>

			<div class="description">
				<p>
					I intend to challenge the concept of the perfect human with the intervention of GAN, in this case,
					StyleGAN2, which is commonly used for producing unlimited number of portraits of fake human faces.

					<br><br>

					After pre-process the image dataset which is composed of every 12 frames per second from a 360p
					low-resolution video found on YouTube, I loaded 9,408 images and started training that lasted 16h
					33m 12s.

				<!-- details re: training-->
				<p>
					The video above shows the original frames from the film undergoing 709 iternations of training over
					time. Looking at these previews, I cannot help but think about how the placement of images resembles
					the filmstrips, and each of the frames is isolated yet interconnected.

				<p>VIDEO PROJECTION</p>
			</div>
			<div class="description">
				<p>
					For the first version of the installation, I chose to present it through video installation because
					of the fact that projection will ease the crispness of pixels and blur the images with ambiguity.
					Also historically, 1960s has been the years where there were a lot of "educational videos" being
					produced with similar aestheics.

					The video installation version of the work with lightbox was selected as part of the Digital + Media
					Biennial at Sol Koffler Gallery which later traveled to Boston CyberArts.

					<br><br>

					The digital transfer from 16mm film has been chosen has official selection in Hallucinea Film
					Festival in Paris, France, and it has been part of an online exhibition <a href="https://www.gallery263.com/exhibitions/makingmoves/" target="_blank" style="font-size: 30px; border-bottom: solid 4.5px;"><i>Making Moves</i></a> at Gallery 263,
					Cambridge, MA.

					The work was also featured in <a href="https://www.theindy.org/article/2591" target="_blank" style="font-size: 30px; border-bottom: solid 4.5px;"><i>The College Hill Independent*</i></a>
					newspaper on Feb 18, 2022 and will soon be published in <a href="https://analogcookbook.com/" target="_blank" style="font-size: 30px; border-bottom: solid 4.5px;"><i>Analog Cookbook</i></a>
					Issue #6 including an artist interview.
