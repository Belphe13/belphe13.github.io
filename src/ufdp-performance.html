		<p> <i>Untitled Disinfect Film Project</i>: Performance is a 30-minute performance-installation exploring
			censorship
			and information control through the live chemical manipulation of film. Wearing full protective gear, I
			apply precise mixtures of hydrogen chloride and sodium chlorite onto the developed yet image-less
			Ektachrome, triggering rapid reactions that alter the emulsion within seconds. These transformations -
			images forming, distorting, or disappearing - are projected in real time, exposing the fragility of the
			medium and the instability of what can be recorded or remembered.

			<br><br>

			After the performance, the chemically altered film is presented as a continuous projection loop, with the
			treated strips displayed as physical artifacts. Together, the performance and installation form a compact
			narrative about erasure, control, and the traces that survive intervention.
