          Although most planktonic creatures are only visible under microscopes, they are crucial aquatic organisms that
          marine ecosystems rely on just as binary numeric expression (0 and 1) is fundamental to computing. In the past
          few decades, data collection for plankton time series has been completed using traditional techniques and
          manual classification. With image classification powered by machine learning algorithms, researchers now have
          more robust and accurate systems to identify different kinds of planktons.<br><br>

          Captivated by the morphology of planktons, we wonder what new planktonic creatures can machine generate? Where
          might they appear and how might they coexist in different planktonic habitats through projections? We trained
          neural networks based on image datasets of planktons, made inland holograms based on machine learning
          outcomes, and eventually conducted and documented experiments in oceans and estuaries.<br><br>

          We used annotated plankton images collected by automated submersible imaging-in-flow cytometry at Martha's
          Vineyard Coastal Observatory from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI). With the WHOI image database as
          input, we successfully trained machine learning models with Runway ML and generated hundreds of plankton
          images and latent space videos on Google Colab.<br><br>

          We will present the index of 400 planktons that might not exist in real life but are close to the original
          ones, the video of projection experimentations on surfaces such as water, rocks, and beaches, as well as the
          artifacts of planktons on microscope slides printed in both 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional forms.<br>
