        <pre class="tab1">					<p><cite>      Just once I knew what life was for.
      In Boston, quite suddenly, I understood;
      walked there along the Charles River,
      watched the lights copying themselves,
      all neoned and strobe-hearted, opening
      their mouths as wide as opera singers;
      counted the stars, my little campaigners,
      my scar daisies, and knew that I walked my love
      on the night green side of it and cried
      my heart to the eastbound cars and cried
      my heart to the westbound cars and took
      my truth across a small humped bridge
      and hurried my truth, the charm of it, home
      and hoarded these constants into morning
      only to find them gone.
