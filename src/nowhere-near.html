            August 20 - 28, 2023
            <br>
            Gallery 263, Cambridge, MA
            <br>
            <br>
            On view in <i>Nowhere Near</i> is a curated selection of photographs and experimental film installations—some of which were made during Yang's six-week residency this summer and some of which were made this past year—that delve into the essence of memory and its dissolution.  
            <br>
            <br>
            <i>Nowhere Near</i> features Yang's pseudo-film installations, which defy traditional filmmaking norms by employing a unique non-chemical method to create 16mm and 35mm films. This pioneering approach melds analog and digital realms, utilizing inkjet/laser printing and laser cutting techniques. This exhibition chronicles Yang's introspective solo journeys through the Pacific Northwest, the Atlantic Coastline, and a poignant voyage to the American West. It stands as both a visual narrative and a meditation on perception by contemplating ways of seeing and not seeing. Moreover, the exhibition delves into an experimental juxtaposition between film and memory, exploring how films' natural and mechanical degradations as an archival medium mirror the gradual erosion of memories over time.
