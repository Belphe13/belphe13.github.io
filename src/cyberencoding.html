				<p>Inspired by two of the <i><a href="/p5js/" target="_blank" style="font-size: 30px; border-bottom: solid 4.5px;">P5.JS PRACTICES</a></i>, CyberEncode is
					another attempt of video processing with pixel manipulations, a showing of appreciation towards
					cinema in different forms. Can the recreation of film footages become something more? And what are
					some interconnections between three films made in different countries from the different decades?

					What would a trip to Jupiter be like? I knew that I wanted to recreate something based off 2001: A
					Space Odyssey without a heartbeat. The main reason to choose the renowned <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebmwYqoUp44" target="_blank" style="font-size: 30px; border-bottom: solid 4.5px;">Stargate Sequence</a></i> is not
					because of its eerie journey to Jupiter, from one space to another, but also the technique Stanley
					Kubrick utilized while filming this scene. It was an experimentation with slit-scan photography
					where the filmmakers have to <i><a href="https://airandspace.si.edu/stories/editorial/making-2001s-star-gate-sequence" target="_blank" style="font-size: 30px; border-bottom: solid 4.5px;">‚Äúbuild the new
							equipment, new types of cameras and lighting systems‚Äù</a></i>.
					<br><br>
					Back in the 60s, there's no comparable computer-generated imagery technology when the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresenham%27s_line_algorithm" target="_blank" style="font-size: 30px; border-bottom: solid 4.5px;">Bresenham's line algorithm</a></i> was
					only developed in 1962.
					<br><br>
					Thus, my plan is to reverse-engineer the scene using the computer graphic technology at that time as
					a degeneration of the existing footage, which became the pixel-based discrete graphical display.

					What other science fiction may be as significant as <i>2001</i>? Someone else would name
					<i>Solaris</i> by Andrei Tarkovsky or <i>Blade Runner</i> by Ridley Scott. But I'd say
					<i>Stalker</i> adapted from a novel called <i>Roadside Picnic</i>. Instead of an expedition into
					outer space, I would like to shift my focus to the exploration into the unknown regions on Earth.
					There is ‚Äúthe zone‚Äù and ‚Äúthe room‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe zone‚Äù is an enigmatic and dangerous wilderness where the
					normal rules of reality do not apply while ‚Äúthe room‚Äù is capable of granting only true desires. And
					this particular scene was when the trio of visitors entering ‚Äúthe zone‚Äù, unnerving but dreamlike.
					The choice of dots is a migration from the print quality of Sots Art, pop art that was introduced to
					Soviet Union during the 70s, and also inspired by Soviet space-age mosaics, to match with the eerie
					electronic score of the clanking railway car wheels.

					<i>Akira</i> was another film I wanted to do so badly but I could not fully understand that film. I
					chose Ghost in the shell instead, the Japanese anime made in 1995 which is distinguishable from the
					horrible remake in the recent years.
					<br><br>
					The three components of human psyche: id, ego and super-ego is critical to Ghost in the shell, which
					is also reflected in its triangular logo in the movie poster. And the specific <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebkGo-nUPhk" target="_blank" style="font-size: 30px; border-bottom: solid 4.5px;">shelling scene</a></i> denotes the
					making of the Major as a cyborg, but she later finds out about her implanted memory and
					subconsciousness, goes on her journey looking for self-identity.
