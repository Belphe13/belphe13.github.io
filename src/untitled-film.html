					As Borges once said, ‚ÄúCensorship is the mother of metaphor.‚Äù This 16mm structural film explores how
					state control breeds its own linguistic and visual resistance. Created in response to China's
					"zero-COVID" policy‚Äîwith its harsh lockdowns, relentless testing, and severe restrictions that
					tragically culminated in the √úr√ºmqi fire‚Äîthis project treats developed image-less Ektachrome as an
					"unclean" object in need of cleansing. By applying chlorine dioxide to film surfaces‚Äîfollowing
					government disinfection guidelines during the pandemic‚Äîthe work transforms physical material into a
					metaphor for censorship and information control in mainland China. Untitled Film Disinfection
					Project examines the delicate intersection of public health measures, state control, and artistic
					resistance.

					This print is 100 feet of developed yet unexposed Ektachrome, chemically altered through direct
					contact
					with hydrogen chloride and sodium chlorite. Following China's zero-COVID policy guidelines for
					surface
					disinfection during the 2022 pandemic lockdowns, these chemical agents were applied to image-less
					Ektachrome.

					<br><br>

					The resulting celluloid surface reveals organic undulations and fragmented constellations‚Äîfluid,
					vein-like structures dissolve into scattered, particulate forms. Like blank pages that carried
					silent
					resistance during the White Paper Movement, where absence became a form of protest, and the act of
					wiping clean only made visible what could not be erased.
