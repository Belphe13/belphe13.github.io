This site is built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/).

## Development

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
2. Build the site:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```
   The generated site will be in the `_site` directory.

All HTML files live in the `src/` directory and share a common layout with global navigation and scripts. Static assets such as CSS and JavaScript are copied to the output unchanged.
