				<p>IDEATION</p>

			<div class="description">
				<p>I was inspired by a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ry9X2FPfHM" target="_blank" style="font-size: 30px; border-bottom: solid 6px;">YouTube Video</a> which mapped the opening
					scene of <i>Baby Driver</i>. However, instead of making a video with tools much as Adobe After
					Effects to animate all the routes, I had this visualization automaton in mind which uses webpages as
					the medium and allows user interactions to explore the map online. </p>

				<p>Now we have coordinates, but how can we show the movement from point A to point B? <br><br>
					I’ve seen several visualizations online like this <a href="https://codepen.io/idafroseth/pen/NpLMOx" target="_blank" style="font-size: 30px; border-bottom: solid 6px;">Google Maps Animation</a>
					with all the coordinates along the way and connected by straight lines. When the number of dots is
					large enough, it creates smooth turns with Json. However, Online Google Maps API Documentation has
					been extremely helpful resources to request a route with specific transportation method varied from
					walking to public transportation. So, in a short word, this project is composed of many route
					requests to the Google server. <br>

					<i>Paris, Texas</i> (1984) directed by Wim Wenders is one of my favorite films in the 80s. It's a
					road movie by its core. The stories started with Travis, the protagonist, who has been vanished in
					society for four years re-appeared in the dessert inside Big Bend National Park. These road trips
					are back and forth between Texas and California, which exemplifies the dynamics of movements in
					terms of a geographical locations that could possibly evoke viewers' experience of moving through
					space. For this film, I chose to only have one map of Southeastern part of United States and created
					an overlay that covered additional sea areas to play snapshots of the film to get audiences a
					geographical sense of the places when a 145-min film shrinking into 30 seconds.

				<br>
				<p>Comparatively, <i>Frances Ha</i> (2013) is a more recent production takes places mostly in New York
					City. There was also a fair amount of travels in this film where the protagonist visited Sacramento,
					Paris and Upstate New York. Since there were multiple places, the decision is to have maps for each
					of the location with an additional world map to get a big picture.</p><br>

				<p>IMPROVEMENTS</p>
			</div>
			<div class="description">
				<p>To further understand a director's film locations throughout their career, more data visualizations
					could be created on one film director, to better analyze their moving patterns, interests of certain
					regions and transportation preferences throughout their career.<br><br>
					Technically, the data collection process could also be optimized with deep-learning programs to
					recognize locations by video processing to extract frames in the film, In this way, it could reduce
					the time and efforts to generate more visualizations with the utilization of a back-end
					database.<br></p>

			<div class="description">
				<p>Special thanks to Ben Grosser, a professor in New Media at University of Illinois at

					encouraged me to think beyond the traditional method.<br><br>
					To my dearest friend Gail Cheng from University of Florida, who helped me out of her way by
					repeatedly watching B&amp;W <i>Frances Ha</i> on Netflix and matching storefronts on Google Street
					View.<br><br>
					And to all my friends who offered aesthetic suggestions and technical supports, I couldn’t create
					this prototype without them.<br>

					<p>Not that Paris, Texas itself has been iconic in cinema history for its vivid color palette and geographical span from Texas to California, back to Taxas then into the void, but it also has provided me with personal reflections over matters

					<p>Frances Ha! Appreciation to a dearest old friend who recommended this film to me during high school, and I have been recommended to others ever since. We don't see the reason not to fall for the story that mostly happened in New York City
						with a few small trips to Sacremnto, CA, Paris, France and Poughkeepsie, NY. </p>
